## About this project
Gameplay is an app that helps you to never miss a gaming appointment with your friends!

### How I built it
I discovered this project during the Next Level Week - Together (2021), with the instructor and developer Rodrigo Gon√ßalves from <a href="https://www.rocketseat.com.br">Rocketseat</a>. </br>
I did a few modifications and add new features to the project, but the idea came from the NLW. I learned a lot from this project, and I'm sure I've reached the next level.

### Learnings in this mission
1 - Project prototype and User Experience in mobile applications </br>
2 - Working with a deadline and a focused goal </br>
3 - Using context API of React Native </br>
4 - AsyncStorage to store user schedule data </br>
5 - API's consumption (Discord developers API) with HTTP Methods and Token Authentication </br>
6 - Creating my own form validation </br>
